    Implements RSA encryption and decryption using the unified crypto API.

import Foundation

/*! Implements RSA encryption and decryption for small chunks of data.
 *  \details The exact definition of "small" depends on the key size and the padding in
 *      use.  The key size represents the maximum size, and from that you subtract
 *      the padding overhead (11 bytes for PKCS#1, 42 bytes for OAEP).  For example, a
 *      2048-bit key with PKCS#1 padding can encrypt 245 bytes (2048 bits -> 256 bytes - 11).
 *
 *  \warning This is for encrypting and decrypting small amounts of data, not an
 *      entire file.  The standard technique for encrypting a large file is to
 *      encrypt it with a symmetric algorithm (like AES-128), using a randomly generated
 *      key, and then encrypt that key with RSA.  However, doing that sort of thing
 *      correctly is a challenge and we recommend you use some standard encryption
 *      scheme (such as CMS).
 *
 *  \note The designated initialiser for this class is private.  In the unlikely event you
 *      need to subclass it, you will have to make that public.
 *
 *  \details This uses the unified asymmetric crypto API added in iOS 10 and macOS 10.12.
 *
 *      If your deployment target does not guarantee the availability of the unified asymmetric
 *      crypto API, use QCCRSASmallCryptorCompat instead.

     *      PKCS#1 v2 / RFC 2437.  That is, it uses SHA1 as its hash function.  It does not
     *      support SHA2-based OAEP algorithms because it wants to present the same
     *      interface as QCCRSASmallCryptorCompat, and that class relies on legacy APIs that
     *      only support SHA1.
