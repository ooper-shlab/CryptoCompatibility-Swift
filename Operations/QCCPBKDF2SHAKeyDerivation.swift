    Abstract:
    Derives a key from a password string using the PBKDF2 algorithm.

import Foundation

/*! Derives a key from a password string using the PBKDF2 algorithm.
 *  \details One key aspect of PBKDF2 is that it takes a significant amount of time to calculate the
 *      key from the password, which helps to defeat brute force attacks.  This time is proportional
 *      to the number of 'rounds' done by PBKDF2.  To get the best security, you should set 'rounds'
 *      as high as you can such that PBKDF2 in a reasonable amount of time on your target hardware.
 *
 *      This operation facilitates this by allowing you to specify a target derivation time.  The
 *      operation will automatically set the rounds parameter so that key derivation takes that
 *      amount of time on the current hardware.  It will also return the number of rounds taken,
 *      so you can save that away along with the key and the salt.
 *
 *  \warning You should *always* set the salt to some random data and save that random data along
 *      with the key.  This a) ensures that users with the same password don't end up using the same
 *      key, and b) as a consequence of this, protects from rainbow table attacks.
 *
 *  \details To use this operation, first generate a key:
 *
 *          1. use a cryptographically sound random number generator to generate some salt data
 *
 *          2. initialise the object with the required parameters, including that random salt
 *
 *          3. set `derivationTime` to a reasonable derivation time for a typical user login
 *
 *          4. run the operation
 *
 *          5. save the salt, the actual rounds and the derived key
 *
 *      When the user tries to log in you can run the operation again:
 *
 *          1. initialise the object with the required parameters, where the password string
 *              is the string the user entered and the salt is the salt you saved with the key
 *
 *          2. set the operation's rounds to be rounds you saved with the key
 *
 *          3. run the operation
 *
 *          4. get the derived key and compare it to your saved key
