/*! Implements AES encryption and decryption with PKCS#7 padding.
 *  \details In padded AES, the unencrypted data can be of any length wbile the length of the
 *      encrypted data is always an even multiple of the AES block size (`kCCBlockSizeAES128`,
 *      or 16).  Encrypted the data will always increase its length (slightly), while decrypting
 *      it will do the reverse.
 *
 *      This operation supports both EBC and CBC mode.
 *
 *  \warning In most cases you will want to use AES in CBC mode; to do that securely, set the
 *      initialisation vector (via the `ivData` property) to some cryptographically sound
 *      random data.  If you need to use EBC mode, which is generally not recommended, set
 *      the `ivData` property to nil.
 *
 *  \note The designated initialiser for this class is private.  In the unlikely event you
 *      need to subclass it, you will have to make that public.
 *
 *  \note If the data to encrypt or decrypt is too large to fit in memory, take a look at
 *      `QCCAESPadBigCryptor`.
